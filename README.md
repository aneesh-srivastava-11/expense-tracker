# 💸 Cashlytics-Flask Expense Tracker (Learning Project)

Cashlytic is a **basic web app** I made while learning **Flask** and trying out **MongoDB integration** hands-on.  
It’s not a big production app — just a small project to understand how backend and database work together.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ➕ Add, ✏️ Edit, 🗑️ Delete expenses  
- 📊 View all expenses and totals  
- 💾 Data stored in MongoDB  
- 📅 Basic date & category inputs  
- 🧠 Perfect for learning CRUD and Flask fundamentals

---

## 🎯 Purpose

I built this project mainly to:
- Get comfortable with **Flask routing & templates**
- Learn how to **connect MongoDB** with Flask
- Understand **CRUD operations** and form handling
- Try out **deploying Flask apps** on Render

It’s meant for **practice and learning**, not a production-level tracker.
